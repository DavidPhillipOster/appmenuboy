**AppMenuBoy** creates a menu of your applications off of its dock icon.

When OS X 10.5.0 (Leopard) changed the way that folders are represented in the Dock, I lost a handy start menu made by dragging the Applications folder to the end of the dock.

This is a small Cocoa application that creates a hierarchical menu, in the dock, and when it is the frontmost app, in the menu bar, of your apps. It only shows apps. If a folder has a single app, it hoists the app up, so no subfolders of exactly one app.

In later versions of OS X, you have to control click on the AppMenuBoy doc icon to see the application menu.

**AppMenuBoy** is [open source](http://code.google.com/p/appmenuboy)
